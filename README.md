# Markov Text Generator

This project is a Markov text generator that uses a given corpus of text to generate new, coherent text based on the statistical analysis of word transitions. The generated text follows the patterns and style of the original corpus.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command:

Make sure you have `numpy`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `spacy`, and their respective dependencies installed as well. If not, you can install them using `pip`.

You also need to download the `punkt` tokenizer from NLTK. Run the following command to download it:

## Usage

1. Prepare your input text:
   - Create a text file containing the input text corpus.
   - Add a delimiter line consisting of `----------` after the corpus to indicate the end of the corpus. This is required for the program to identify the end of the input text.

2. Run the code:
   - Execute the Python script.
   - You will be prompted to upload the input text file. Select the file from your local machine.
   - The program will process the file and generate a Markov model based on the input text.

3. Generated Story:
   - The program will generate a story using the Markov model.
   - The story will start with a given word or phrase (specified in the code) and continue until the specified word limit is reached.
   - The generated story may not be grammatically correct, but you can use the grammaticize function to improve the grammar.

4. Grammaticize Text:
   - The `grammaticize_text` function uses the GingerIt library to correct grammar in the generated story.
   - The `grammaticize_text1` function uses the spaCy library to split the generated story into sentences and correct grammar in each sentence.
   - You can modify these functions or use alternative methods to improve the grammar of the generated text.
